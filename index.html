      <p>
        Hey there! Have you ever played rock, paper, scissors? It's a classic
        game that's easy to learn but fun to play, and now you can play it
        against the computer in this HTML, CSS, and JS game.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Click on one of the three buttons: <b>🧱, 📄, or ✂️</b>. at the top
          side of your device.
        </li>
        <li>The computer will also choose a weapon.</li>
        <li>
          The winner is the player who chose the weapon that beats the other
          player's weapon.
        </li>
        <li>
          If both players choose the same weapon, it's a tie and the game goes
          for <b>10 rounds</b> .
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Here are some tips for winning:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Try to predict what the computer will choose. For example, if you've
          been playing for a while and the computer has chosen rock a lot, you
          might want to choose paper next time.
        </li>
        <li><span style="color: rgb(249, 4, 179);">
          Don't be afraid to change up your strategy. The computer is likely to
          be trying to predict what you'll choose, so don't be too predictable
          yourself.
        </span>
        </li>
        <li>
                Have fun! Rock, paper, scissors is a great game to play with friends
                or family.
